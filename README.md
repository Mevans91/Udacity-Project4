This is my 4th project for the Udacity Nanodegree. It uses the Sentiment Analysis API from MeaningCloud.com to perform Natural Language Processing on a blog or any other piece of online text, URL provided by the user. 

Websites processed will be given a possible score of:
P+: strong positive
P: positive
NEU: neutral
N: negative
N+: strong negative
NONE: without sentiment

They will also be analyzed to determine is the text is subjective, confident in it's premise, and whether its written ironically or not.
